# MOOC Problems
This repo is the place where I put some problems from MOOC (Coursera/ Edx) and also my solutions.  

## Princeton - Algorithms - Part 1
Course materials are available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)   
Here is a list of the problems from this course:
- [Percolation](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/miaozn/MOOC/blob/master/princeton-algs-part-1/assignments/percolation.html)
- [Randomized Queue](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/miaozn/MOOC/blob/master/princeton-algs-part-1/assignments/queues.html)
- [Collinear](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/miaozn/MOOC/blob/master/princeton-algs-part-1/assignments/collinear.html)
- [8 Puzzle](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/miaozn/MOOC/blob/master/princeton-algs-part-1/assignments/8puzzle.html)
- [Kd Tree](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/miaozn/MOOC/blob/master/princeton-algs-part-1/assignments/kdtree.html)  
    
I [solve](https://github.com/miaozn/MOOC/tree/master/princeton-algs-part-1/solutions) those problems in Java since the provided testing utils are written in Java. However, feel free to use any language.  
## Tsinghua -- Data Structures
Course materials are available on [Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/subject/computer-science)  
TBD..
